/// The builder automatically infers mutation categories using three-phase analysis:
///
/// Step 1 (Direct Analysis):
///   - If memberRoutine writes to any member variable of me -> Writable
///   - If memberRoutine calls .grasp() on me member variables -> Writable
///
/// Step 2 (Call Graph Propagation):
///   - If memberRoutine calls a Writable memberRoutine on me -> Writable
///   - If memberRoutine calls a Reshaping memberRoutine on me -> Reshaping
///   - Repeat until fixpoint (no changes)
///
/// Step 3 (Token Checking):
///   - Viewing/Consulting tokens can only call Readonly memberRoutines
///   - Modifying/Amending tokens can call Readonly or Writable memberRoutines
///   - Only owned/non-token access can call Reshaping memberRoutines
/// </remarks>
