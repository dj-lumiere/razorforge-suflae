// Comptime `expand` safety gate (requirement: a GATED wired-protocol operation applied to a comptime
// member value `me.$nameof(m)` inside an expand template must be backed by the enclosing routine's
// `needs P everywhere` gate — otherwise nothing guarantees every member supports it, and the unrolled
// call would only fail deep in monomorphization/codegen). This turns that into a clean build error.
//
// UNIVERSAL wired ops (represent/diagnose/serialize — protocols with NO `everywhere` self-constraint)
// need no gate: every type has them. The distinction is DATA-DRIVEN off each protocol's own
// declaration, so if a today-universal op is later made opt-in (its protocol gains `needs P
// everywhere`), this check auto-requires the gate with no code change here.
