/// the wrapper handle; codegen must (a) re-resolve a wrapper-shadowed <c>represent</c>/<c>diagnose</c>
/// to the inner value's, and (b) project the <c>RoamController</c> handle to the bare inner pointer
/// via <c>raw_inner()</c> for a bare-<c>me</c> inner memberRoutine (a Roamed-<c>me</c> inner memberRoutine — an SF
/// entity's own — takes the handle directly). Both the codegen member-call path and
/// <c>OperatorLoweringPass</c> route their Roamed receivers through here so the rule lives in one
/// place. Genuine Roamed-own memberRoutines (<c>roam</c>/<c>promote</c>/<c>lock_enter</c>/<c>raw_inner</c>/
/// <c>destroy</c>) are deliberately left alone — their name never resolves onto the inner.
