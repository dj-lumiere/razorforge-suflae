/// v0.2.0 Phase 5b-2 (Mechanism C): inserts coroutine cancellation push/pop markers into the
/// bodies of may-suspend routines, so a coroutine abandoned while parked tears down exactly the
/// owned values it had constructed (the design's cancellation shadow stack).
///
/// <para>The markers are sentinel <see cref="CallExpression"/>s (<c>__rf_cf_push(local)</c> /
/// <c>__rf_cf_pop(local)</c>) — no new AST node and no visitor surface. This pass runs LAST (after
/// all analysis/lowering, just before codegen), so nothing else observes the markers; codegen
/// recognises them and emits the <c>rf_coro_cf_push</c>/<c>rf_coro_cf_pop</c> runtime calls.</para>
///
/// <para>Consistency-by-construction: the set of instrumented locals is DERIVED from the inline
/// <c>local.destroy()</c> calls <c>ScopeTeardownLoweringPass</c> already inserted. A push goes
/// right after a local's construction (so a value built *after* a suspend point is not on the stack
/// before it — partial init), and a pop right before each of that local's inline
/// <c>$destroy</c> (so the node is removed exactly when the inline teardown runs — the value can
/// never be torn down twice). Empty may-suspend set ⇒ this pass is a no-op.</para>
///

/// bodies are a follow-up (until then a may-suspend member routine that owns resources would leak
