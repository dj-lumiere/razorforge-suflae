/// abandon-teardown (design doc <c>internal-wiki/v0.2.0-coroutine-primitive.md</c> §6).
///
/// A routine is <b>may-suspend</b> if it can ever be parked at a coroutine suspend point. That is
/// true when it: (a) directly invokes a suspend primitive (<see cref="SuspendPrimitives"/>), (b)
/// makes an indirect/dynamic call whose target the static graph cannot see (treated conservatively
/// as may-suspend), or (c) transitively calls another may-suspend routine.
///
/// Only may-suspend routines get cancellation frames in Phase 5; everything else keeps today's
/// exact codegen. Over-approximation is safe — it only adds shadow-stack push/pops (a perf cost),
/// never affects teardown correctness — so the analysis is deliberately conservative and starts
/// fully so: any unresolved indirect call poisons its routine.
///
/// Mechanically this is the dual of <see cref="MutationInference"/>: the same monotonic
/// call-graph fixpoint, but information flows callee → caller and across <i>every</i> edge (not
/// just calls on <c>me</c>), because a suspend anywhere below you can park you.
