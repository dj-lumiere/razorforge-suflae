/// Tests for the async-spawn argument boundary (RF-S632). A `threaded routine` spawns an OS thread

/// parallel with its siblings, so BOTH boundaries enforce the same crossing rule: an argument is
/// safe when it is `steal`-moved (exclusive transfer), trivially-copyable value data (passed BY
/// VALUE), or a thread-shareable wrapper (Atomic/Shared/Watched/Consulting/Amending — carries its
/// own synchronization). Anything else passed by copy — a bare entity, or a record/tuple that
/// transitively owns a single-threaded RC wrapper (Retained/Tracked) or single-threaded token
/// (Viewing/Modifying) — would silently alias unsynchronized state across parallel coroutines and
