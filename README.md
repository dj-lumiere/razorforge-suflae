# RazorForge

**Make programming sharp again.**

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-early%20alpha-orange.svg)

RazorForge is a natively compiled, statically typed programming language built around two ideas:

1. **Single-ownership memory management without a borrow checker** — containment is ownership,
   transfers are explicit (`steal`), borrows are scoped — so you get deterministic cleanup and
   use-after-move rejection without lifetime annotations or a garbage collector.
2. **Compiler-generated error handling** — write one failable routine (`routine parse!(...)`),
   and the compiler derives `try_parse` (returns `Maybe[T]`), `check_parse` (returns `Result[T]`),
   and `lookup_parse` variants for every calling style. No exceptions, no boilerplate.

It compiles to native code through LLVM and runs on Windows x86-64 and Linux x86-64 today.
It is aimed at **performance-minded application work** — CLIs, services, games, data tools —
where you want native speed and deterministic memory behavior. It is *not* a kernel/bare-metal
language: programs link against the RazorForge runtime library, and there is no freestanding mode.

> **Honesty first:** RazorForge is an early alpha. The compiler, runtime, and standard library
> work — 1,400+ unit tests and 92 end-to-end snapshot fixtures run green in CI on every commit —
> but the language is young, APIs will change, and you will find bugs. Its sibling language
> **Suflae** is a *design* (see [Suflae status](#suflae-design-preview)) and is **not implemented yet**.

## A Taste of RazorForge

### Failable routines and generated variants

```razorforge
module Demo
import IO/Console

# `!` marks a failable routine. The compiler auto-generates try_/check_/lookup_
# variants, so callers choose how to consume failure — no exceptions involved.
routine get_text!(n: S64) -> ?Text
  when n
    == 0 => throw DivisionByZeroError()
    == 1 => return "hello"
    else => return "world"

routine start()
  var m = try_get_text(n: 0)   # generated variant -> Maybe[Text]
  when m
    is None => show("absent")
    else v  => show(f"present: {v}")
  return
```

### Ownership is explicit

```razorforge
entity Resource
  tag: S64

routine consume(r: ?Resource)
  show(f"consuming tag={r.tag}")
  return
  # r's $destroy fires here — exactly once, deterministically

routine start()
  var b = Resource(tag: 7)
  consume(r: steal b)   # ownership transferred; using `b` afterwards is a compile error
  return
```

- Entities have a single owner; assignment of an entity requires `steal` (error `RF-S413` otherwise).
- Scoped borrows (`view`/`modify`, `Hijacked[T]`) express intent without lifetime syntax.
- Reference counting (`Retained[T]`, `Tracked[T]`) is available when you opt into sharing.

### Calls are readable by default

```razorforge
# Multi-parameter calls require named arguments — call sites document themselves.
var g = gcd(a: 252, b: 105)
discard seen.add(value: v)   # ignoring a return value is explicit, too
```

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10.0+
- LLVM 20+ (`clang` and `opt` on PATH)
- CMake 3.20+ and a C compiler (for the native runtime)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://git.lumi-dev.xyz/Lumi/razorforge-suflae.git
cd razorforge-suflae

dotnet build        # builds the compiler AND the native runtime (via CMake)
dotnet test         # optional: run the test suite
```

### Hello, world

```razorforge
# hello.rf
module Hello
import IO/Console

routine start()
  show("Hello from RazorForge!")
  return
```

```bash
./bin/Debug/net10.0/RazorForge buildandrun hello.rf
# Windows: .\bin\Debug\net10.0\RazorForge.exe buildandrun hello.rf
```

### CLI reference

```
RazorForge <source-file>                  Parse file and show AST summary
RazorForge parse <source-file>            Parse file and show AST summary
RazorForge tokenize <source-file>         Tokenize file and show tokens
RazorForge codegen <source-file> [out.ll] Generate LLVM IR (single file)
RazorForge build [entry-file] [out.ll]    Build a multi-file project
RazorForge buildandrun [entry-file]       Build, link, and execute
RazorForge check [entry-file]             Type-check only (no codegen)
RazorForge validate-stdlib [rf]           Validate stdlib routine bodies
RazorForge help                           Show usage
RazorForge version                        Show compiler version
```

**There are no build flags.** All build configuration lives in the
`razorforge.toml` manifest's single `[target]` section:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-app"

[target]
executable = "MainModule"          # entry module (by `module` declaration, not file path)
library = ["../shared-utils"]      # external dependency directories (optional)
mode = "debug"                     # debug -O0 | release -O2 | release-time -O3 | release-space -Os
```

`library` entries are directories — relative to the manifest — whose modules join
the import search space, requirements.txt-style. (When the package manager lands,
entries will also accept versioned packages from the package site, e.g.
`"json-utils@1.2.0"`, fetched into a cache that builds consume the same way.)
With no entry file given, the CLI searches the current and parent directories for
`razorforge.toml` — `cd` into a project and `razorforge buildandrun` just works.

## What Works Today

- **Compiler pipeline**: lexer → parser → semantic analysis (350+ structured diagnostics with
  `error[RF-S###]: file:line:col` format) → desugaring/monomorphization → LLVM IR → native binary.
- **Memory model**: single-ownership entities with deterministic `$destroy`, explicit `steal`
  transfer, scoped borrows, `Retained`/`Tracked` reference counting, `danger!` blocks for
  opt-in unsafe operations.
- **Error handling**: failable routines (`!`), `throw`/`absent`, generated `try_`/`check_`/`lookup_`
  variants, `Maybe[T]`/`Result[T]`/`Lookup[T]` carriers, `when` pattern matching.
- **Numerics**: `S8`–`S128`, `U8`–`U128`, `F16`–`F128`, decimal `D32`/`D64`/`D128`, arbitrary
  precision `Integer`/`Decimal`, complex numbers — with checked, wrapping, clamping, and
  overflow-reporting arithmetic variants.
- **Collections**: `List`, `Dict`, `Set`, `Deque`, `BitList`, sorted collections, fixed-size
  `Array[T, N]`, iterator adapters (`select`, `where`, `zip`, `enumerate`, …).
- **Text**: UTF-32 `Text` type, f-string interpolation with format specs, `Bytes` with UTF-8
  iteration.
- **Interop**: `external("C")` declarations for calling C from RazorForge.
- **Generics**: type parameters with protocol constraints, const generics (`Array[T, N]`),
  monomorphization.
- **Quality gates**: every commit runs 1,400+ unit tests plus 92 end-to-end fixtures that
  compile, link, execute, and diff program output against snapshots — on Linux CI; Windows is
  exercised continuously during development.

### Platform support

| Platform       | Status                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Windows x86-64 | Working (primary development platform)       |
| Linux x86-64   | Working (CI-verified on every commit)        |
| macOS / ARM64  | Target definitions exist, **not yet tested** |

## Suflae (design preview)

Suflae is RazorForge's planned sibling: same type system and standard library surface, but
garbage-collected, with arbitrary-precision numerics by default and actor-model concurrency
(`suspended` routines, `waitfor`, `.act()`). The grammar is designed and partially parsed,
and the docs at [suflae.lumi-dev.xyz](https://suflae.lumi-dev.xyz/) describe the design —
**but there is no Suflae standard library or runtime yet, and Suflae programs cannot run.**
It will land after RazorForge stabilizes.

## Philosophy

- **Total development cost** over raw runtime performance
- **Clear, descriptive words** over obscure historical terms
- **Explicit** over implicit — ownership transfers, named arguments, discarded returns
- **Honesty** over marketing hype — including in this README

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature suggestions, documentation improvements, and code contributions are all
welcome. The best place to start is running the fixture suite (`dotnet test`) and reading
`tests/Fixtures/Stdlib/` for live examples of the language.
